# Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio uses UI principles and responsive design to showcase other front end projects of mine. I explored JavaScript interactivity, CSS transitions, and CSS flex, and I designed all of the graphics myself.

## Getting Started

I commented throughout the files, but let me know if you have any questions. To view this project live on GitHub Pages, please visit [this link](https://jamie-ev.github.io/Portfolio/). Thanks for dropping by!
